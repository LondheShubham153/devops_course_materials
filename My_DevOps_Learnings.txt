Its Great Learning from Shubham Bhaiyya.
I am basically working since 1.5 years in java domain. 
Worked mostly in support and some dev. But wanna get into low code env i.e devops and Azure cloud
So my expectation is i would get complete knowledge and experience from this training, so that i can endeavour my career in this domain and have to switch my first company within next 6 months.
I hope i would enjoy learning from shubham bhaiyya and fullfill my aspirations.
