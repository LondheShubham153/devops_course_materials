Hi Shubham Bhaiya,
I would like to first thank you for coming up with such an amazing  and interactive live course on devops. I am currently working in tcs from last one year under a project of automation in which we use technologies like ansible, terraform, gitlab ci, powershell,etc. I do have  a basic knowledge of all these tools and use them in developing various automation pipelines in my company. I want to dive deep into all these technologies along with the fact of learning development side by side to be a better technology enthusiast and professional in the years to come by. I really love the way you teach and make concepts simple and easy to understand helping us enhance our knowledge in different technologies. 

The Learning I had from our first week class are:
Clarifying my concepts of cherry-pick
Learning about git merge, and the difference between git rebase
git stash and git squash
git pull and git fetch.


I am really excited to learn new things and be a better version of myself through little steps and contributing my learnings in a better way.
