Hello Sir ,

Myself Pratik Deshmukh (deshmukhpratik570@gmail.com)
Thank You for amazing lecture on GIT and GITHUB
Really Understood Git and GITHUB 
like how stage a file by adding (means tracking it) then commiting it 
git basic comands like git status, add, commit, pull ,log --oneline, push ,checkout, switch , branch ,remote -v ,fetch 
rebase -i HEAD~2 (squash union of multiple commit), 
rebase(leveling two branches without extra commiting) ,
merge (merging two branches), 
cherry-pick(picking particular commit from other branch through getting hash of that commit in logs),
Stash , etc
